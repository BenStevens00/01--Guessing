# 01--Guessing
This is my first project for C-220: a guessing game, written in python.The purpose of this game is to tach me about simple data types and control structures.

The player is asked to guess from a number between 1 and 100. The player then has as many opportunities as necessary to refine the guess. The game reports the total number of tries taken.
